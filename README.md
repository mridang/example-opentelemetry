Notes:

Even after installing the OTEL libraries, you must explicitly install
these packages

* The [`https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/id-generator-aws-xray`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/id-generator-aws-xray)
package so that the IDs are compliant.
* The [`@opentelemetry/propagator-aws-xray](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/propagator-aws-xray)
library which I'm unusre about.

These libraries do not need to be installed `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-aws-sdk`
as these are bundled.

On AWS, the OTEL must generate Ids that are understandable by XRay
and that's why the `AWSXRayIdGenerator` is used.

> A trace_id consists of three numbers separated by hyphens.
> For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. For trace IDs
> created by an X-Ray SDK, or by AWS services integrated with X-Ray,
> a trace ID includes:
>
> **Trace ID Format**
> * The version number, for instance, 1.
> * The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8 hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time is 1480615200 seconds, or 58406520 in hexadecimal.
> * A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal digits.
>
> > Note
> > Trace IDs created via OpenTelemetry have a different format based on the W3C Trace Context specification. A W3C trace ID must be formatted in the X-Ray trace ID format when sending to X-Ray. For example, a W3C trace ID 4efaaf4d1e8720b39541901950019ee5 should be formatted as 1-4efaaf4d-1e8720b39541901950019ee5 when sending to X-Ray. While X-Ray trace IDs include the original request timestamp in Unix epoch time, this is not required or validated.

By exporting all the traces to the console, we can see that the ids
generated by the `AWSXRayIdGenerator` don't comply with this format.
With little to no literature around this, I assume that this is to
do with the fact the there is an internal spec that denotes what
the trace ids must be like.

[Minor] When running Jaeger, you need to set up SSL certificates or
you're going to need to switch to insecure communication between the
collector and Jaeger.

[Major] Most extensions in the Otel Collector are still in development
or in beta. This includes simple extensions like the health check
which are currently marked as [in beta](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/extension/healthcheckextension/README.md).
Since so many extensions are currently in beta, a production rollout
of the Otel Collector seems scary as you don't know what will go
south in production.
